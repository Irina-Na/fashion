# ðŸ‘— Fashion Stylist â€” Streamlit App

LLM-powered demo that generates a complete **total look** from natural-language
requirements and immediately searches your product catalog for matching items.

## Features
* GPT-4o (or any GPT-4.x) parses the user brief into a structured `OneTotalLook`.
* Pandas filters your enriched catalog (`df_enriched.parquet`) to suggest
  concrete SKUs for every part of the outfit.
* One-click Streamlit UI, fully containerised.
